## The Culture Coded Dev - Code Samples

Welcome to the companion repo for **The Culture Coded Dev** — a series where I break down Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using real-life, culturally grounded metaphors that actually stick.

Whether you're:

- 👩🏾‍💻 A software engineer brushing up for interviews
- 🎓 A bootcamp grad trying to really _get it_
- 🌟 Or someone who just learns better when the learning reflects the culture...

**This repo — and the full series — is for you.**

Each file walks through a different DSA concept — starting with:
**`two-pointer` → Two Pointer Pattern (ft. Beyoncé’s concert finale)**

## 📚 What You’ll Find in This Repo

This repo contains coding samples that pair with each post in The Culture Coded Dev series. Each file includes:

- Starter problems you can clone and code along with
- Fully worked examples based on culturally relevant scenarios
- Clean, well-commented Python code (JavaScript and others coming soon)
- Occasional notes, hints, and diagrams to deepen understanding

## How to Use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syscily/cultureCoded.git
cd cultureCoded
```

## 🔗 Follow Along

New posts drop regularly!  
Catch the full breakdowns on [Medium](https://medium.com/@culturecoded.dev)  
and stay in the loop as the series grows.

## 💡 Every Lesson Follows the Same Structure:

1. **The Approach** – A breakdown of the core DSA technique
2. **The Culture Code** – A real-world metaphor (like Love Island, RHOA, Kobe in the clutch, etc.)
3. **The Code** – A sample implementation you can run, edit, and remix
4. **The Use Cases** – When, where, and why this pattern matters in real life or tech interviews

## 💬 Contributions Welcome

Got a better metaphor? Want to add a new language implementation?  
Open a PR or drop an issue — I'd love to build this together.
